About Oileide

Oileide is a small AJAX library with the following features:

- unobtrusive: Only the window.oileide object is created, all methods
  are methods of this exposed object

- auto mode: With the right HTML markup, links are automatically
  transformed to load HTML via an AJAX request and load the content
  of the request into an element on the page. An overlay is added
  automatically to indicate loading, and if the browsers fails to
  complete the AJAX request, either because of no support for that or
  non-available Javascript, the link still points to the desired content.
  Headers and footers can still be in the markup of the page and will not
  be shown on the ajaxified page itself. Even bookmarking of the page
  with ajaxified content is possible, because Oileide uses the location
  of the browser to store this information.

- All the rest is standard for AJAX libraries: Get HTML/XML/JSON via
  synchronous / asynchronous requests and doing callback functions,
  although not everything is implemented yet.

- One main goal is to be a small library.

How Auto Mode Works

- reference the file in the <head> of the (X)HTML document via
  <script src="oileide.js?auto"></script> to trigger auto mode or
  include onload="window.oileide.run()" in the body tag, in case of
  renaming the file.

- You should also include <link rel="stylesheet" href="oileide.css"
  type="text/css" /> to use the "even more better" functions of auto mode.

- Links that should be ajaxified need the following attributes:
  * id: The content of this attribute will be appended to the location
        after the hash (#), in case of more than one clicked link, the
        IDs will be in a comma separated list. If you do not set an
        id, then nothing will be appended to the browser location.
  * href: The link to the site to be loaded via AJAX. Only GET method
          is implemented, any ideas on how to implement POST are welcome
  * rel: This is the trigger, and is used in the form
         rel="oileide[elementId]", where elementId is the ID of the
         element whose content will be replaced by the AJAX content.

  Here is an example:
      <p id="my-content"></p><a href="test.html"
          rel="oileide[my-content]" id="mylink">Click Me</a>

      Clicking this link will add #mylink to the location in the browser,
      and load the body content of test.html into the <p> with
      id="my-content"

- Should you load the page with anchors in auto mode, all AJAX requests
  will be made in the same sequence as indicated via the location, although
  for reasons stated in the "even more better" functions synchronous.

- But there's even more:
  * the element that will hold the ajaxified content will
    be overlayed by a div and a loading gif to indicate the load in the
    background.
  * Any element with the class "olympic" on the loaded HTML file (in the
    example test.html) will not be displayed on the original page, so
    you can include header / footer for navigation and overall look and
    feel on the page for the non-Javascript browsers and still load the
    same page via AJAX. Graceful degradation ain't sh*t to Oileide.
  * Content that is loaded via auto mode will be parsed automatically
    for <a> tags with the right markup to ajaxify them as well. That is
    the reason to make the calls after reload synchronous, to be sure that
    the links are already on the page.

- Last, but not least: Where does the name come from?
  In the Trojan War, there were two Greek heroes named Ajax, Ajax son of
  Telemon, called the Great, and Ajax the Lesser, king of Locris. The
  latter was the son of Oileus, therefore yielding the cognomen Oileide.
  So Oileide is Ajax the Lesser. Some more mythology about him: Ajax
  the Lesser was a fast runner, only second to Achilleus, and beaten by
  Odysseus on Patroklos's funeral, because Athena tripped him. He was
  also renowned for his expertise with the spear, and raped Cassandra
  during the sack of Troy (That is why the overlays over the divs have
  the class "cassandras-veil"). And because several Olympic gods took
  part invisibly in the Trojan War on both sides, the elements of the
  loaded documents that should not be displayed need the class "olympic".
